## ⚠️ WHAT'S MISSING (PRD Gaps)

### 1. **Onboarding: 0/10** ❌ CRITICAL
**PRD Says:** "70% of users who don't get value in first 24 hours never return"

**Current State:**
- No welcome screen
- No profile collection
- No guided first test
- No instant gratification moment

**Impact:** High drop-off risk

**Fix:** Phase 10 (Onboarding) - 3-4 hours

---

### 2. **Push Notifications: 0/10** ❌ HIGH
**PRD Says:** "Create daily habit loops with variable rewards"

**Current State:**
- No notifications at all
- No daily reminders
- No pattern alerts
- No milestone celebrations

**Impact:** No daily return trigger

**Fix:** Phase 11 (Notifications) - 4-5 hours

---

### 3. **Predictions: 0/10** ❌ MEDIUM
**PRD Says:** "Let users plan their life around biology like a weather forecast"

**Current State:**
- Only current ReadyScore
- No tomorrow prediction
- No 7-day forecast
- No validation loop

**Impact:** Missing curiosity loop ("was prediction right?")

**Fix:** Phase 13 (HormoCast™) - 6-8 hours

---

### 4. **Progressive Unlocks: 2/10** ❌ LOW
**PRD Says:** "Day 1 and Day 90 users should have different experiences"

**Current State:**
- Flat experience (everyone sees everything)
- No badges/achievements
- No feature unlocks
- No celebration moments

**Impact:** No sense of progression

**Fix:** Phase 14 (Gamification) - 4-5 hours

---

### 5. **Proactive Insights: 4/10** ⚠️ MEDIUM
**PRD Says:** "Don't wait to be asked - surface insights automatically"

**Current State:**
- Patterns calculated but not surfaced
- No "new insight discovered" alerts
- No proactive AI messages
- User must actively search

**Impact:** Intelligence exists but hidden

**Fix:** Phase 16 (Proactive Intelligence) - 6-8 hours
